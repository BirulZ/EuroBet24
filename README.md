The online gambling industry, particularly the professional sports betting sector, is experiencing annual growth. However, this industry also faces significant challenges that need to be addressed. Prominent issues include data security and insufficient transparency,which adversely affect user confidence and often discourage potential new participants from engaging in the online gambling market. A potential solution to these problems could be blockchain technology, which is considered by many recent studies to be a viable answer. Blockchain technology is characterized by decentralization, transparency, immutability and the elimination of necessary intermediaries, which could lead to cost savings, particularly from the userâ€™s perspective. In this paper, we present a proof-ofconcept realized through a decentralized, smart contract-based betting platform for the UEFA EURO 2024. The system is developed using the Solidity programming language and deployed on the Sepolia Testnet on the Ethereum blockchain. The findings indicate that deploying such a platform on the blockchain is indeed feasible. This paper primarily serves as a framework for future work, especially for the addition of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, in which we see great potential for the use case of a betting platform.
